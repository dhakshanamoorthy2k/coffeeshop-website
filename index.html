                <h4>cortado</h4>
                <p> it’s the fusion of espresso with warm milk. The beauty of this drink is that the milk reduces the bitterness and acidity of the coffee while adding a touch of sweetness and improvement in the overall texture. And since it’s done in a ratio of 1:1, it preserves the flavors of espresso.</p>
